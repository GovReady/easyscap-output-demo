title: Set SSH Idle Timeout Interval
description: |
  \
  \
   To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` as follows:

      ClientAliveInterval interval

  The timeout **interval** is given in seconds. To have a timeout of 15
  minutes, set **interval** to 900. \
  \
   If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login shell, that
  value will preempt any SSH setting made here. Keep in mind that some
  processes may stop SSH from correctly detecting that the user is idle.
