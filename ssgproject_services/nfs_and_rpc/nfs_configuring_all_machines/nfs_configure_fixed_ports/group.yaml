title: Configure NFS Services to Use Fixed Ports (NFSv3 and NFSv2)
description: |
  \
  \
   Therefore, restrict each service to always use a given port, so that
  firewalling can be done effectively. Note that, because of the way RPC
  is implemented, it is not possible to disable the RPC Bind service even
  if ports are assigned statically to all RPC services. \
  \
   In NFSv4, the mounting and locking protocols have been incorporated
  into the protocol, and the server listens on the the well-known TCP port
  2049. As such, NFSv4 does not need to interact with the
  `rpcbind, lockd, and rpc.statd` daemons, which can and should be
  disabled in a pure NFSv4 environment. The `rpc.mountd` daemon is still
  required on the NFS server to setup exports, but is not involved in any
  over-the-wire operations.
