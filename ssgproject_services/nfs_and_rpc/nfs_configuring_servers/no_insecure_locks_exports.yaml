title: Ensure Insecure File Locking is Not Allowed
description: |
  `insecure_locks` option can be used so these clients can access the
  desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the
  client access to data for which it does not have authorization. Remove
  any instances of the `insecure_locks` option from the file
  `/etc/exports`.
