title: Restrict Information Published by Avahi
description: |
  `[publish]` section:

      disable-user-service-publishing=yes

  Implement as many of the following lines as possible, to restrict the
  information published by Avahi.

      publish-addresses=no
      publish-hinfo=no
      publish-workstation=no
      publish-domain=no

  Inspect the files in the directory `/etc/avahi/services/`. Unless there
  is an operational need to publish information about each of these
  services, delete the corresponding file.
