title: Restrict Web Directory
description: |
  `/var/www/html`) Directory allows directory indexing (`Indexes`) and the
  following of symbolic links (`FollowSymLinks`). Neither of these is
  recommended. \
  \
   The `/var/www/html` directory hierarchy should not be viewable via the
  web, and symlinks should only be followed if the owner of the symlink
  also owns the linked file. \
  \
   Ensure that this policy is adhered to by altering the related section
  of the configuration:

      <Directory "/var/www/html">
      #  ...
         Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      #  ...
      </Directory>
