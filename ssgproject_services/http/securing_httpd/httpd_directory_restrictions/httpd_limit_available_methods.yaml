   Note: `GET` and `POST` are the most common methods. A majority of the
  others are limited to the WebDAV protocol.

      <Directory /var/www/html>
      # ...
         # Only allow specific methods (this command is case-sensitive!)
         <LimitExcept GET POST>
            Order allow,deny
         </LimitExcept>
      # ...
      </Directory>
