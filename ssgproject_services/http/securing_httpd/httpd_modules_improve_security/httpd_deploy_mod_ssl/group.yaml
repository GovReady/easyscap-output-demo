   Note: `mod_nss` is a FIPS 140-2 certified alternative to `mod_ssl`. The
  modules share a considerable amount of code and should be nearly
  identical in functionality. If FIPS 140-2 validation is required, then
  `mod_nss` should be used. If it provides some feature or its greater
  compatibility is required, then `mod_ssl` should be used.
