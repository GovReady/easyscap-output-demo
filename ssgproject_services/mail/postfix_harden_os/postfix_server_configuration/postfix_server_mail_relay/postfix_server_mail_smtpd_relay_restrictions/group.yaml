title: Enact SMTP Relay Restrictions
description: |
  \
   The full contents of `smtpd_recipient_restrictions` will vary by site,
  since this is a common place to put spam restrictions and other
  site-specific options. The `permit_mynetworks` option allows all mail to
  be relayed from the machines in `mynetworks`. Then, the
  `reject_unauth_destination` option denies all mail whose destination
  address is not local, preventing any other machines from relaying. These
  two options should always appear in this order, and should usually
  follow one another immediately unless SMTP AUTH is used.
