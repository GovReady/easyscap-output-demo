title: Network Time Protocol
description: |
  \
  \
   If every system on a network reliably reports the same time, then it is
  much easier to correlate log messages in case of an attack. In addition,
  a number of cryptographic protocols (such as Kerberos) use timestamps to
  prevent certain types of attacks. If your network does not have
  synchronized time, these protocols may be unreliable or even unusable. \
  \
   Depending on the specifics of the network, global time accuracy may be
  just as important as local synchronization, or not very important at
  all. If your network is connected to the Internet, using a public
  timeserver (or one provided by your enterprise) provides globally
  accurate timestamps which may be essential in investigating or
  responding to an attack which originated outside of your network. \
  \
   A typical network setup involves a small number of internal systems
  operating as NTP servers, and the remainder obtaining time information
  from those internal servers. \
  \
   More information on how to configure the NTP server software, including
  configuration of cryptographic authentication for time data, is
  available at http://www.ntp.org.
