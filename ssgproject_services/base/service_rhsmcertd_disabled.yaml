title: Disable Red Hat Subscription Manager Daemon (rhsmcertd)
description: |
  `rhsmcertd` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rhsmcertd off
rationale: |
  `rhsmcertd` service can provide administrators with some additional
  control over which of their systems are entitled to particular
  subscriptions. However, for systems that are managed locally or which
  are not expected to require remote changes to their subscription status,
  it is unnecessary and can be disabled.
