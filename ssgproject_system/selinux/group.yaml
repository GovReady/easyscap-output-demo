  \
   The default SELinux policy, as configured on RHEL 6, has been
  sufficiently developed and debugged that it should be usable on almost
  any Red Hat machine with minimal configuration and a small amount of
  system administrator training. This policy prevents system services -
  including most of the common network-visible services such as mail
  servers, FTP servers, and DNS servers - from accessing files which those
  services have no valid reason to access. This action alone prevents a
  huge amount of possible damage from network attacks against services,
  from trojaned software, and so forth. \
  \
   This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the default
  (targeted) policy on every Red Hat system, unless that system has
  unusual requirements which make a stronger policy appropriate.
