title: Disable Core Dumps
description: |
  \
  \
   Once a hard limit is set in `/etc/security/limits.conf`, a user cannot
  increase that limit within his or her own session. If access to core
  dumps is required, consider restricting them to only certain users or
  groups. See the `limits.conf` man page for more information. \
  \
   The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The `sysctl`
  variable `fs.suid_dumpable` controls whether the kernel allows core
  dumps from these programs at all. The default value of 0 is recommended.
