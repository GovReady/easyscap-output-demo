title: Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Activation
description: |
  `/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf` to reboot the system when the
  Ctrl-Alt-Del key sequence is pressed:

      exec /sbin/shutdown -r now "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"

  \
   To configure the system to log a message instead of rebooting the
  system, alter that line to read as follows:

      exec /usr/bin/logger -p security.info "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"
rationale: |
  `initscripts` package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 system, custom
  changes to `/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf` may be overwritten. Refer
  to https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/70464 for additional
  information.
