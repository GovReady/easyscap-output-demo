title: Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity
description: |
  `/etc/default/useradd`, substituting `NUM_DAYS` appropriately:

      INACTIVE=NUM_DAYS

  A value of 35 is recommended. If a password is currently on the verge of
  expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
  disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days,
  then 95 days could elapse until the account would be automatically
  disabled. See the `useradd` man page for more information. Determining
  the inactivity timeout must be done with careful consideration of the
  length of a “normal” period of inactivity for users in the particular
  environment. Setting the timeout too low incurs support costs and also
  has the potential to impact availability of the system to legitimate
  users.
