   In RHEL 6, rsyslog has replaced ksyslogd as the syslog daemon of
  choice, and it includes some additional security features such as
  reliable, connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the
  option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en
  route to a central logging server. This section discusses how to
  configure rsyslog for best effect, and how to use tools provided with
  the system to maintain and monitor logs.
