title: Rsyslog Logs Sent To Remote Host
description: |
  \
  \
   However, it is recommended that logs be stored on the local host in
  addition to being sent to the loghost, especially if `rsyslog` has been
  configured to use the UDP protocol to send messages over a network. UDP
  does not guarantee reliable delivery, and moderately busy sites will
  lose log messages occasionally, especially in periods of high traffic
  which may be the result of an attack. In addition, remote `rsyslog`
  messages are not authenticated in any way by default, so it is easy for
  an attacker to introduce spurious messages to the central log server.
  Also, some problems cause loss of network connectivity, which will
  prevent the sending of messages to the central server. For all of these
  reasons, it is better to store log messages both centrally and on each
  host, so that they can be correlated if necessary.
