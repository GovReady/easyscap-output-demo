   Unlike TCP Wrappers, which depends on the network server program to
  support and respect the rules written, Netfilter filtering occurs at the
  kernel level, before a program can even process the data from the
  network packet. As such, any program on the system is affected by the
  rules written. \

   This section provides basic information about strengthening the
  iptables and ip6tables configurations included with the system. For more
  complete information that may allow the construction of a sophisticated
  ruleset tailored to your environment, please consult the references at
  the end of this section.
