title: Network Configuration and Firewalls
description: |
  \
  \
   This section also discusses firewalls, network access controls, and
  other network security frameworks, which allow system-level rules to be
  written that can limit an attackers’ ability to connect to your system.
  These rules can specify that network traffic should be allowed or denied
  from certain IP addresses, hosts, and networks. The rules can also
  specify which of the system’s network services are available to
  particular hosts or networks.
rules:
- network_disable_zeroconf
- network_sniffer_disabled
subgroups:
- network_disable_unused_interfaces
- network-kernel
- network-wireless
- network-ipv6
- network-iptables
- network_ssl
- network-uncommon
- network-ipsec
