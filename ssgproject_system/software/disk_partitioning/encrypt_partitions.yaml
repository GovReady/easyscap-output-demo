title: Encrypt Partitions
description: |
  \
  \
   For manual installations, select the `Encrypt` checkbox during
  partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is
  selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting
  the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered
  manually every time the system boots. \
  \
   For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart
  by adding the `--encrypted` and `--passphrase=` options to the
  definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following
  line would encrypt the root partition:

      part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE

  Any *PASSPHRASE* is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the
  Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the
  `--passphrase=` option from the partition definition will cause the
  installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during
  installation. \
