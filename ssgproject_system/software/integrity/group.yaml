   Integrity checking cannot *prevent* intrusions, but can detect that
  they have occurred. Requirements for software integrity checking may be
  highly dependent on the environment in which the system will be used.
  Snapshot-based approaches such as AIDE may induce considerable overhead
  in the presence of frequent software updates.
